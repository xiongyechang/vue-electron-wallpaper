# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@master

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Build
        uses: actions/setup-node@master
        # uses 和 run 不能在同一个步骤里面
      
      - name: build start
        run: echo Build Start!

      - name: npm install
        run: npm install # 安装第三方包

      - name: npm build
        run: npm run build:linux # 打包

      - name: build end
